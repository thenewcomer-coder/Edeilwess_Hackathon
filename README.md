In this project I created a functioning website which fetched data from a terminal emiting data in little ending encryption.The backend fetched the data from the terminal running at port 9011.Parsed it and sent it to the front end.
The backend was created using node js and socket.io to fetch the data.The connection is a TCP/IP connection.
On the front end the live data was received and rendered dynamically.
The front end was created using react pagination and react tables.
The data had about 600,000 rows in an excel format.
